This establishes the foundation for the entire AutoMine ecosystem.

### **Goal**

- To create a fully functional MVP of AutoMine with core automation features.
- To ensure all project best practices (security, testing, integration) are implemented.
- To establish a solid foundation for future feature expansion.

### **Success Criteria**

- All core smart contract functions are implemented and tested.
- Frontend provides complete user and admin interfaces.
- Bot successfully automates mine switching operations.
- End-to-end system integration is working and tested.
- Ready for testnet deployment and user testing.
