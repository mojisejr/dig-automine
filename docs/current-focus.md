# Current Focus: AutoMine Phase 1B.2 - Real Testnet Testing Execution Plan

**Updated:** 2025-08-29  
**Priority:** High

## Current Status

Phase 1B.1 (Bot-Contract Integration Testing) และ Phase 1B.2 infrastructure setup เสร็จสมบูรณ์แล้ว ตอนนี้พร้อมสำหรับการ execute real testnet testing และรายงานผลตามแผนที่วางไว้

## 🚀 Phase 1B.2 Testing Execution Plan (Ready to Execute)

### 📋 Testing Execution Sequence

#### Phase A: Initial Deployment & Setup (Day 1)

```bash
# Step 1: Complete automated setup
npm run setup:phase1b2 YOUR_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY

# Step 2: Validate deployment
npm run validate:real-testnet

# Step 3: Test real contract connections
npm run test:real-nft
```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ AutoMine.sol deployed to BitkubChain testnet
- ✅ Real DigDragon contract integration verified
- ✅ Hash power retrieval from real storage contract working
- ✅ Cross-contract communication validated

#### Phase B: Performance Testing (Day 2-3)

```bash
# 4-hour intensive performance testing
npm run test:performance
```

**Target Metrics:**

- Transaction success rate: **>98%**
- Bot response time: **<30 seconds**
- Gas optimization efficiency validated
- Network congestion handling tested

#### Phase C: 24-Hour Reliability Testing (Day 4-5)

```bash
# 24-hour continuous operation testing
npm run test:24hour
```

**Validation Points:**

- System uptime: **>99.5%**
- Continuous operation stability
- Network disconnection recovery
- Bot restart and state recovery

#### Phase D: Real-World Scenario Testing (Day 6)

```bash
# Test real mine switching scenarios
cd packages/bot
npm run dev:testnet

# Monitor real mine events and bot responses
# Test edge cases and error handling
```

**Scenario Validation:**

- Real mine opening/closing event responses
- Competition scenarios with other users
- Emergency procedures on real network
- Economic model validation with real fees

### 📊 Comprehensive Reporting Plan

- **Phase D Report**: `docs/reports/real-scenario-test-{date}.json`
- **Final Summary**: `docs/reports/phase1b2-complete-{date}.md`

### 🎯 Success Criteria & Reporting Metrics

#### Technical Performance Targets

- **Transaction Success Rate**: >98% (measured across all test phases)
- **Bot Response Time**: <30 seconds (from mine event to action)
- **System Uptime**: >99.5% (during 24-hour testing)
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient usage within projected costs

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to Report

1. **Deployment Success**: AutoMine.sol deployed and verified on testnet
2. **Integration Success**: Real DigDragon contract interactions working
3. **Performance Metrics**: All targets met during testing phases
4. **Reliability Metrics**: 24-hour continuous operation completed
5. **Economic Validation**: Real transaction costs vs. projections
6. **Security Validation**: No vulnerabilities found in real environment
