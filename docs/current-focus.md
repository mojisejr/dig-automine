# Current Focus: AutoMine Phase 1B.2 - Real Testnet Validation & Performance Testing

**Updated:** 2025-08-29  
**Priority:** High

## Current Status
Phase 1B.1 (Bot-Contract Integration Testing) completed successfully. Moving to Phase 1B.2: Real Testnet Validation & Performance Testing. All mock testing has been validated, and the system is ready for real BitkubChain testnet deployment and comprehensive validation.

## Phase 1B.2: Real Testnet Validation & Performance Testing (Current Focus)

### 1. Real Testnet Environment Setup
- **Deploy AutoMine.sol** to BitkubChain testnet with real contract verification
- **Connect to actual DigDragon contracts** on testnet (not mocks)
- **Configure testnet wallet** with sufficient KUB tokens for extended testing
- **Set up monitoring infrastructure** for real blockchain interactions
- **Establish testnet-specific environment** variables and configurations

### 2. Real Contract Integration Testing
- **Real DigDragon NFT Integration**: Test with actual DigDragon NFTs on testnet
- **Real Mine Contract Interactions**: Connect to actual DigDragonMine contracts
- **Cross-Contract Communication**: Test AutoMine interactions with real external contracts
- **Hash Power Validation**: Verify hash power retrieval from real HashPowerStorage contract

### 3. Performance & Reliability Testing

#### 3.1 Network Performance Testing
- Measure transaction confirmation times on real network
- Test bot performance under network congestion
- Validate gas price optimization strategies
- Monitor transaction failure rates and retry mechanisms

#### 3.2 Load Testing
- Test bot with multiple concurrent users (simulated)
- Validate system performance with large NFT batches
- Test database performance under real load
- Monitor memory and CPU usage during extended operations

#### 3.3 Reliability Testing
- 24-hour continuous operation testing
- Network disconnection and reconnection handling
- Failed transaction recovery mechanisms
- Bot restart and state recovery testing

### 4. Real-World Scenario Testing

#### 4.1 Mine Switching Scenarios
- Test during actual mine opening/closing events
- Validate timing accuracy with real blockchain timestamps
- Test competition scenarios with other users
- Measure optimal switching window performance

#### 4.2 Edge Case Validation
- Test with insufficient gas scenarios
- Validate behavior during network upgrades
- Test with contract interaction failures
- Validate emergency procedures on real network

#### 4.3 Economic Model Validation
- Test fee collection with real transactions
- Validate reward distribution accuracy
- Test economic incentives and user behavior
- Monitor actual gas costs vs. projected costs

### 5. Comprehensive Reporting & Analytics

#### 5.1 Real Performance Metrics
- Transaction success rates on real network (target: >98%)
- Average gas consumption per operation
- Bot response time to mine events (target: <30 seconds)
- System uptime and reliability metrics (target: >99.5%)

#### 5.2 Economic Performance Reports
- Actual vs. projected gas costs
- Fee collection efficiency
- User reward optimization results
- ROI analysis for users

#### 5.3 Technical Performance Documentation
- Network latency impact analysis
- Database performance under real load
- Bot scalability assessment
- Security audit results from real interactions

### 6. Production Readiness Validation

#### 6.1 Security Validation
- Real contract security testing with actual funds
- Private key management validation in production-like environment
- Access control testing with real user scenarios
- Emergency procedure testing on real network

#### 6.2 Operational Readiness
- Monitoring and alerting system validation
- Backup and recovery procedure testing
- Documentation completeness verification
- Team operational procedure validation

#### 6.3 User Experience Validation
- Real user journey testing on testnet
