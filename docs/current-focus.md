# Current Focus: AutoMine Phase 1B - Bot Development

**Updated:** 2025-08-28  
**Priority:** High

## Current Status
Moving to Phase 1B: Bot Development. Smart contract foundation (Phase 1A) has been completed. Now focusing on building the automated bot system that will handle mine switching operations.

## Phase 1B: Bot Development (Current Focus)

### Core Bot Structure
- **Node.js service** with TypeScript
- **Environment configuration** for private keys and contract addresses
- **Scheduler** for automated mine switching

### Blockchain Integration
- **Web3 connection setup** for Bitkub Chain
- **Contract interaction layer** for AutoMine contract
- **Transaction monitoring** and error handling

### Automation Logic
- **Mine switching algorithm** based on time schedules
- **User NFT tracking** and management
- **Batch operations** for efficiency

### AWS Lambda Preparation
- **Serverless function structure**
- **AWS Secrets Manager integration** for secure key storage
- **CloudWatch logging integration**

## Implementation Requirements

### Bot Functions Integration
- Interface with AutoMine.sol `switchMine(address _targetMine)` function
- Monitor user NFT deposits and track staking status
- Execute scheduled mine switches for all deposited NFTs
- Handle transaction failures and retry logic
- Provide detailed logging for all operations

### Security & Reliability
- Secure private key management via AWS Secrets Manager
- Transaction monitoring and confirmation
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Rate limiting and gas optimization
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails

## Development Workflow
Following established pattern: Dev Contract → Test Contract → **Dev Bot** → Test Bot with Contract → Dev UI → Test UI with Bot and Contract

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Set up bot package structure in `packages/bot/`
2. Configure TypeScript and Node.js environment
3. Implement Web3 connection for Bitkub Chain
4. Create contract interaction layer
5. Develop core automation scheduling logic

## Success Criteria for Phase 1B
- [ ] Bot successfully connects to Bitkub Chain
- [ ] Bot can interact with AutoMine contract
- [ ] Automated mine switching logic implemented
- [ ] Error handling and logging systems functional
- [ ] AWS Lambda deployment preparation completed
