# Current Focus

## Phase 1: Hydration and UI Polish

**Objective**: Resolve all hydration errors and unify the color scheme across the application.

### Part 1: Hydration Mismatch Error Resolution

**Analysis**: Hydration errors are present in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/nfts/page.tsx`, and `components/navigation.tsx` due to rendering client-side state without proper guards. The `useContractEvents.ts` hook's use of `Date.now()` also contributes to this issue.

**Resolution Plan**:

1.  **Create `useMounted` Hook**: Develop a centralized `useMounted` hook to manage component mount state.
2.  **Global `mounted` Guard**: Apply the `useMounted` hook to all components that use client-side state to prevent server-client mismatch.
3.  **Dynamic Component Refactoring**: Extract client-only UI into dynamically loaded components using `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`.
4.  **Stabilize Timestamps**: Modify `useContractEvents.ts` to use blockchain event timestamps where possible, or protect timestamp-dependent UI with the `mounted` guard.

### Part 2: UI Color Styling Unification

**Analysis**: Inconsistent color styling exists due to hardcoded colors in `Card` components and for various event states.

**Resolution Plan**:

1.  **Audit Hardcoded Colors**: Conduct a project-wide search for all hardcoded color classes.
2.  **Define Semantic Color Variants**: Extend the Tailwind CSS theme in `tailwind.config.js` with semantic color variables for `success`, `warning`, `error`, and `info` states, compatible with both light and dark modes.
3.  **Create `Card` Component Variants**: Refactor the `Card` component to accept a `variant` prop (e.g., `variant="success"`) to apply semantic colors consistently.
4.  **Replace Hardcoded Colors**: Replace all instances of hardcoded colors with the new theme variants.
