## 🚀 Phase 1C.1: User Interface Development (Current Focus)

### 📋 Implementation Priority

**Rationale**: User UI should be implemented first as it represents the core user experience and revenue-generating functionality. Users need to be able to interact with the system to generate value, making this the critical path for MVP launch.

### 🎯 Phase 1C.1 Objectives

1. **Design System Implementation**

   - Implement "silk" theme using oklch color system
   - Create reusable UI components library
   - Establish consistent typography and spacing
   - Implement responsive design patterns
   - Create component documentation and style guide

2. **Core User Pages and Components**

   **Landing Page**

   - Hero section with AutoMine value proposition
   - Feature highlights and benefits overview
   - Getting started guide and onboarding flow
   - FAQ section addressing common user questions
   - Footer with links and social media integration

   **User Dashboard**

   - Wallet connection interface with MetaMask/WalletConnect
   - NFT portfolio display with hash power information
   - Current mine status and countdown timers
   - Staking/unstaking interface with transaction confirmations
   - Earnings tracking and reward history
   - Transaction history with filtering and search
   - Settings panel for user preferences

3. **User-Focused Blockchain Integration**

   - wagmi configuration for Bitkub Chain
   - Wallet connection state management
   - Network switching and validation
   - Transaction state management with user feedback
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Gas estimation and optimization for users

4. **User Experience & Performance**
   - Loading states and progress indicators
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
   - Performance optimization for user interactions
   - User onboarding and tutorial flows

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Phase 1C.1)

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Blockchain Integration**: wagmi, Viem
- **UI Components**: shadcn-ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with "silk" theme (oklch colors)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Testing**: Playwright MCP for E2E testing

### 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] Design system implemented with "silk" theme
- [ ] Landing page with value proposition and onboarding
- [ ] User dashboard with wallet integration
- [ ] NFT portfolio display with hash power information
- [ ] Staking/unstaking interface with transaction confirmations
- [ ] Earnings tracking and reward history
- [ ] Wallet integration with Bitkub Chain working
- [ ] Real-time data display from deployed contracts
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] User experience optimized for core workflows

### 🔄 Development Workflow

Following the established pattern from CLAUDE.md:

1. ✅ **Dev Contract** (Completed in Phase 1A)
2. ✅ **Test Contract** (Completed in Phase 1A)
3. ✅ **Dev Bot** (Completed in Phase 1B)
4. ✅ **Test Bot with Contract** (Completed in Phase 1B.1 & 1B.2)
5. 🚀 **Dev UI** (Current Phase 1C.1)
6. ⏳ **Test UI with Bot and Contract** (Next)

### 📞 Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Navigate to frontend package
cd packages/frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

### 🎯 Next Steps After Phase 1C.1

Upon successful Phase 1C.1 completion → **Phase 1C.2: Admin Interface Development**
